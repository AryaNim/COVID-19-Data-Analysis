# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Overview
A mini data analysis project exploring COVID-19 trends, case counts, and fatality rates using Python and visualization tools.

Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)
- Power BI / Tableau (Optional Dashboard)

 Dataset Used
- Source: [Kaggle COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)
- Contains: Country-wise cases, deaths, recoveries, and dates.

 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning 
   - Removed unnecessary columns (`Lat`, `Long`, `Province/State`).  
   - Handled missing values.  
2. Exploratory Analysis
   - Calculated total global cases & deaths.  
   - Computed fatality rate (`Deaths / Confirmed Cases`).  
3. Visualizations  
   - Line plot: Daily global cases over time.  
   - Bar chart: Top 5 affected countries.  
4. Dashboard (Bonus)  
   - Created interactive visuals in Power BI.
